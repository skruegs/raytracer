raytracer
=========

Recursive raytracer built on a 3D scene graph that features Blinn-Phong shading, reflective and refractive materials, soft shadows, super-sample anti-aliasing, and configurable lights.

Also implemented Monte Carlo path tracing to produce more realistic renders with global illumination, caustics, and soft shadows.
